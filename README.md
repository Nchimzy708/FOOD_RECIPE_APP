

Follow the steps below, use git bash if you are on windows and terminal on other platforms

clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/BongoHive/reponame.git my-portfolio`  
⚠️ Please replace `reponame` in the above link ☝🏾 with the name of this repo

`cd my-app`

restore packages

`npm install`

start the dev server

`npm start` this will also open it in your default browser

if you face errors when you run npm install change package manager by doing the following
 - open another terminal
 - run `npm install yarn --global`
 - cd back into you portfolio project
 - instead of running <del>`npm install`</del>, run `yarn`
 - this should get the project package manger running
 
 
And get hacking .... 😀🚀
